# Problem: Given the parabola \( y^2 = 16x \), the coordinates of the focus are ________.

## Step 1: Decompose the Problem

The given equation is a parabola in the form ( y^2 = 4px ). To find the coordinates of the focus, we need to determine the value of ( p ). Comparing the given equation ( y^2 = 16x ) with the standard form ( y^2 = 4px ), we can see that ( 4p = 16 ).

## Step 2: Solve for p

Now, we solve for ( p ) by dividing both sides of the equation ( 4p = 16 ) by 4. This gives us ( p = 16/4 = 4 ).

## Step 3: Determine the Coordinates of the Focus

The coordinates of the focus of a parabola in the form ( y^2 = 4px ) are ( p, 0 ). Since we found that ( p = 4 ), the coordinates of the focus are ( 4, 0 ). However, we should also consider alternative methods to verify our answer.

## Step 4: Alternative Method - Using the Definition of a Parabola

A parabola is defined as the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus and the directrix. For a parabola in the form ( y^2 = 4px ), the focus is at ( p, 0 ) and the directrix is at ( x = -p ). We can use this definition to verify our answer. Since the given equation is ( y^2 = 16x ), we can see that the parabola opens to the right, and the focus should be at a positive x-coordinate. This is consistent with our previous answer of ( 4, 0 ).

## Step 5: Alternative Method - Using the Equation of a Parabola

The equation of a parabola in the form ( y^2 = 4px ) can be derived from the equation of a circle. By comparing the given equation ( y^2 = 16x ) with the equation of a circle, we can see that the radius of the circle is ( 4 ). Since the focus is at the center of the circle, the coordinates of the focus are ( 4, 0 ). This is consistent with our previous answers.

## Step 6: Re-examine the Answer Using a Different Approach

Let's re-examine the answer by graphing the parabola. By graphing the equation ( y^2 = 16x ), we can see that the parabola opens to the right and the vertex is at the origin. The focus should be at a positive x-coordinate, which is consistent with our previous answers. However, we should also consider the possibility that the focus could be at a different location. Let's try to find the focus by using the definition of a parabola. The definition states that the parabola is the set of all points that are equidistant to the focus and the directrix. By using this definition, we can see that the focus is indeed at ( 4, 0 ).
